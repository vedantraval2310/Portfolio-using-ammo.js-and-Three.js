## Motivation

While exploring [Google Experiments](https://experiments.withgoogle.com/) I discovered an amazing world of web rendering. There are so many incredible web projects out there, and I wanted to learn this technology. I was inspired by many awesome projects, but specifically examples from the [official examples/documentation](https://threejs.org/), [Lee Stemkoski](https://home.adelphi.edu/~stemkoski/) and [Three.js Fundamentals](https://threejsfundamentals.org/).

## Features

- Physics engine (Ammo.js) combined with 3D rendered objects (Three.js) for real-time movement, collision detection and interaction
- Desktop and Mobile Responsiveness with both keyboard and touch screen controls
- Raycasting with event listeners for user touch and click interaction
- FPS tracker to monitor frame rate/ rendering performance
- Asset compression with webpack plugin to help with quick site load times

## Technology

- Three.js (3D Graphics)
- Ammo.js (Physics Engine)
- JavaScript
- Node.js
- Express (Node.js framework)
- Webpack (module/ dependency bundler)
- HTML/CSS
- Hosted on Heroku
- Git (version control) / Github for code hosting

## Usage

To use locally, clone the repository, install dependencies, run using webpack's dev server, and navigate to localhost:8080 in your browser:
